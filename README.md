## Hi, I'm Nath 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a paleoclimatologist (PhD 🎓) working on ocean dynamics during the late Pleistocene (last 800,000 years), with a special focus on past warm periods called Interglacials.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills
- 💻 Python, MATLAB
- 🐙 Git, GitHub, PyCharm, JupyterLab
- 🥼 Sediment analysis: grain-size 📏, X-ray fluorescence ⚛, magnetism 🧲
- 💻 Data compilation, calibration and harmonization

## 📈 Current Projects
- 🌊 A data-driven (ML) model of deep ocean overflow strength over the last 800,000 years
- 🥵 Sea-Surface Temperature (SST) compilations for MIS 7 (190–260 ka) and MIS 9 (300–350 ka)
- 🧠 Investigating surface vs. deep ocean change mechanisms

## 📚 Learning
- GitHub basics 😅
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python 🐍
- Climate model simulation and advanced data-assimilation framework
- Improving my English skills 🇬🇧

## 🤝 Open to Collaborations on:
- Deep ocean dynamics
- Paleoceanographic data compilations
- Data-model comparisons
- Machine learning applied to paleoclimate
